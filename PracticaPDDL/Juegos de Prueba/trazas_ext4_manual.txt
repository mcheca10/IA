metric established (normalized to minimize): ((1.00*[RF0](COSTE)) - () + 0.00)

task contains conditional effects. turning off state domination.



checking for cyclic := effects --- OK.

ff: search configuration is  best-first on 1*g(s) + 5*h(s) where
    metric is ((1.00*[RF0](COSTE)) - () + 0.00)
